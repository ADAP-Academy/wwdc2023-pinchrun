## Project Introduction

In the past, I created a project to help people who have trouble using their hands such as Parkinson's or stroke. The goal was to measure and train hand function using a 3D/VR experience with a special glove. I learned that using a pinch gesture is effective for improving hand function, according to research studies and healthcare professionals. 
For the Swift student challenge, I wanted to make a similar experience without extra equipment or complicated techniques, with only an iPad. I used a camera and Hand Poses Detecting feature of Vision to detect pinch hand gestures, and SpriteKit to create a fun game where players jump over obstacles.

## How to Play

When users start the game, they hold up their hand to the camera and perform pinch gestures, which make the character jump and move forward. The app is a great way to improve hand function in a fun and effective way, without requiring a special glove or device. It can help people who don't have access to therapy or equipment, and provides an entertaining way to enhance their hand function. The app is practical, accessible, and engaging, and can be used to improve hand function.
